Hi, this is S .Puja, currently pursueing my Bca.
This is the project that I made in Java. It is a POS Billing System.
This project can be use as an application in any Commercial Workstation.
It works on the application of storing the items in a database with their 
respective prices and retrieving them as per the customer's requirement.
You can furthur use this application to calculate the total amount of the items 
purchased by the customer and print a detailed item-specified bill.


* This project was made using the Swing GUI in Java.
* The IDE used was Netbeans. 
* The Database was created and worked upon XAMP SQL localhost server.
* I have attached a sample database details in a file.
